# Weatherstation
Software used to read data from 4 sensors (temperature, humidity, lightintensity, atmospheric pressure) by an arduino mega 2560 and transmit this data over serial interface to store it as csv in a raspberry Pi 3 Model B.

Sensors: temperature + humidity: si7021 (interface: I2C); lightintensity: photodiode (interface: adc); atmospheric pressure: BMP180 (interface: I2C)
